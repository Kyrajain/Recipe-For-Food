LET'S START GUYS!
You can make this with childern also.

Ingredients-
1-tablespoon Cocoa Powder.(I recommend Cadbury cocoa-powder).
6-tablespoons Milk.
2-tablespoons Salted Butter.
1-drop Vanilla Essence.
3-tablespoons All-purpose Flour.(I use WHEAT FLOUR personally,so it healthy also.NO TASTE DIFFERENCE).
1/4 -teaspoon Baking Powder.
4-tablespoons Crushed Sugar.
2-tablespoons Chocolate chips.(optional).

Prep-
Melt the butter.

How to Make-
Take a microwave safe mug.
Put the all-purpose flour and the cocoa powder in it.
Put the crushed sugar in it with the baking powder.
Mix well with a fork in and one direction.Don't change the direction.
Then,put the melted butter and Vanilla extract.
Mix well again.
Lastly,put milk.The more milk,the more it is tasty.BUT MIND,don't put more than 8 tablespoons.
Mix all this in the mug only.
The result should be a light brown thick batter.

Now,after taking out the fork,put the Microwave safe mug in the Microwave.
Microwave the batter for 1:20 secs.
The batter will rise.It is intresting to watch that.I always am exited to see it rise.
Take out the freshly made aromatic 3-Minute Chocolate Mug Cake and let it rest for 2 minuts.It will be hot.Leave it untouched for the 2 minutes.
pour over the chocolate chips and-
ENJOY!
